/* Created trigger called trg_insert_enrollment which executes after inserting into enrollments. It iterates over each row and will go to the next value from the sequential function created from question 1. Then it fits the rest of the parameters required for the logs table. Same theory for trg_delete_enrollment, except we use :OLD B# and class id. */
