# Student-Registration-System

This project is to use Oracle's PL/SQL to create an application to support typical student registration tasks in a university. The following tables from the Student Registration System will be used in this project: Students(B#, firstname, lastname, status, gpa, email, bdate, deptname) Courses(dept_code, course#, title) Course_credit(course#, credits) Classes(classid, dept_code, course#, sect#, year, semester, limit, class_size) Enrollments(B#, classid, lgrade) Grades(lgrade, ngrade) Prerequisites(dept_code, course#, pre_dept_code, pre_course#)

In addition, the following table is also required for this project: Logs(logid, who, time, table_name, operation, key_value) Each tuple in the logs table describes who (the login name of a database user) has performed what operation (insert, delete, update) on which table (give the table name) and which tuple (as indicated by the value of the primary key of the tuple) at what time. Attribute logid is the primary key of the table. The schemas and constraints of the first six tables are the same as those used in Project 1 except that attribute faculty_B# in table Classes is removed (please make the corresponding change in the script used in Project 1). Please use the following statements to create the Prerequisites table and the Logs table: create table prerequisites (dept_code varchar2(4) not null, course# number(3) not null, pre_dept_code varchar2(4) not null, pre_course# number(3) not null, primary key (dept_code, course#, pre_dept_code, pre_course#), foreign key (dept_code, course#) references courses on delete cascade, foreign key (pre_dept_code, pre_course#) references courses on delete cascade); create table logs (logid number(4) primary key, who varchar2(10) not null, time date not null, table_name varchar2(12) not null, operation varchar2(6) not null, key_value varchar2(10)); You should populate these tables with appropriate tuples to test your programs.
